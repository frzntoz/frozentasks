# Frozen Tasks README

Welcome to Frozen Tasks, an task management extension tool for Visual Studio Code. It is based on the principles of [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/), and inspired by the excellent extension [TODO+](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus).

The basic premise is to provide a consistent interface for managing tasks. Bullet Journaling provides not only an uniform interface for day-to-day task lists, but also workflows for managing tasks over time. The magic is the simplicity within this system that it easily works with on paper using loose sheets in a binder or a journal. Frozen Tasks goal is to continue in this vein of simplicity, but provide an interface to do so via vscode. One challenge faced when using bullet journaling on physical media is that indexing and searching can be very challenging when using this system to manage tasks for work.
